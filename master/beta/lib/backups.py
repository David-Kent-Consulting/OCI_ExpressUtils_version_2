class GetVolumeBackupItems:
    '''
    This class fetches and returns to the calling program data about boot and block volumes.
    It requires a storage client instance for both the primary and DR regions, as well as
    the volume type and volume ID. Your code must handle all pre-reqs and error conditions.

    OCI does not provide an efficient tool for a cloud user to get report information about
    volume backup snaps. This class, when used with other code, provides for a simplified
    means of identifying backups to a volume without depending on a policy name.

    Our does not presume that backups are replicated to a DR region, but we do require
    that a secondary region be provided since in most cases VM instance backup datta
    will be replicated between regions.

    CAUTION: This class may consume a significant amount of RAM off the heap. We recommend
    that your code take measures to ensure sufficient RAM prior to calling this code.

    Instiate the class, then call populate_backup_items() to get the backup data.

    return_all_backup_items() will return all backup resources that are found in the two
    regions provided when instiated. If no data is found, None is returned.
    return_all_dr_backup_items() works the same way.
    
    return_backup_item() and return_dr_backup_item() expect to receive a backup item name.
    If that item is found, it is returned, otherwise it returns None.

    return_backups_this_day() expects the date of the backup object to search for in the
    form of DD, MM, YYYY as three integer or string numeric values. It uses string
    concatenation and does a string compare to find the data in time_created in the
    REST backup object, which is instiated from datetime(). This provides for a straight
    forward means to search for that string in each object that we are keying on.
    Both regions are searched for and all backups found for that day are returned to
    your program.
