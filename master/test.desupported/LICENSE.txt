B. Law. The laws of Michigan, USA, govern the Agreement, excluding conflict of law principles which would require application of the law of any other jurisdiction. Each party waives the right to jury trial for any legal action. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act as adopted do not apply.
