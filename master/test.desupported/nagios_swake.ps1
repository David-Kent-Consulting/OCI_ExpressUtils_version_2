###     This is a sleep-wake program. It should be called by the service user ansible once every 10 minutes. It         ###
###     should create .txt files that are then read by a separate program by the service user nagios as the defined     ###
###     plugin. The name of this separate plugin is "nagios_plugin.ps1". The reason for this separation is two fold:    ###
###     1) A nagios plugin must respond in its entirity with a response within 10 seconds or is considered to be        ###
###         unresponsive.                                                                                               ###
###     2) We choose to handle the communications between this sleep-wake program and the program visible to nagios     ###
###         distinctly for security purposes.                                                                           ###
###                                                                                                                     ###
###     You should become familiar with the nagios developer guidelines at the URL below:                               ###
###     https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html                                                                  ###
###     And a nifty example of a shell plugin here:                                                                     ###

###     Check your config as in: sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg                  ###
###     WARNING! - DO NOT WRITE NAGIOS PLUGINS IN PERL, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SDK UPDATES SINCE 2017 FOR PERL AND THE SDK  ###
###     NEVER REACHED MATURITY.                                                                                         ###

###     Any JSON files that are to be loaded should be defined as vars. Load your JSON files within functions to        ###
###     conserve RAM. Always use the "ConvertFrom-Json" and "-AsHashtable" methods to read the JSON data into           ###
###     dictionary objects. All output should be sent to $Path/logs as .txt files. Write to temporary files and then    ###
###     rewrite the destination file path. Always use the same temp file as defined in $TEMP_PATH and always do         ###
###     proper housekeeping by removing this temp file at the end of your function.                                     ###
###                                                                                                                     ###
