### This program calls the programs $backupBootVol and $backupBlockVol, which results ##
### in boot and block volume snap backups replicating from $sourceRegion to         ####
### $targetRegion. It begins by reading from the input file $inputFile, then        ####
### converts the JSON to a dictionary object. The object is walked down and read,   ####
### with values passed to functions and CMDLETS as appropiate. The program will ABEND ##
### on an error, but otherwise runs perpetually. Jobs called by Start-Threadjob     ####
### are properly housekeeped to ensure memory leaks do not ocurr.                   ####
