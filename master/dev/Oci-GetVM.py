The system env var PATHONPATH must be exported in the shell's profile. It must point to the location of the OCI
libraries. This is typically in the same directory structure that the OCI CLI installs to, such as
~./lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages 

Below find a literal example:

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrywojteczko/lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages

OCI does not have a simple way to get IP addresses from a VM instance. The ERD is:
                    vnic_attachment
                          x
                          x
                        vnic_id
                xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                x                   x
                x                   x
            instance_id------->private-ip.id
                                    x
                                    x
                               public_ip.id

We must associate a VNIC with an instance id, then associate all private IPs associated with
the correct vnic_id (which is returned as a list), then finally parse down all of the pub ips
in an availability domain with a private IP. Pay attention to the way OCI returns objects. In
this case, private IPs are returned as a list of for each vnic, and pubips are individual
objects that point back to particular private IPs.
