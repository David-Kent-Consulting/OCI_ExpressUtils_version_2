The system env var PATHONPATH must be exported in the shell's profile. It must point to the location of the OCI
libraries. This is typically in the same directory structure that the OCI CLI installs to, such as
~./lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages 

Below find a literal example:

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrywojteczko/lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages
