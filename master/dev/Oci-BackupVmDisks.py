The purpose of this utility is to manage disk SNAP backups in OCI
outside of the tools provided for in the OCI console. We recommend
that this tool only be used on a case-by-case basis, and rarely,
if at all. The initial use case for this tool is to manage OEM
backups. We must backup OEM cold, aka shutdown the database and
other services, then run the disk SNAPS, and then restart OEM.
This is unfortunately necessary since Oracle has placed restrictions
both within OCI and in the OEM appliance build that render tools
such as RMAN, cp, and zip useless. As of the time of the creation of
this utility, 11-feb-2022, it is not possible to copy large numbers
of files or any file larger than 1GB from the OEM boot volume. We
suspect that Oracle has customized the kernel, but do not know that
with certainty. What we do know with certainty is that the OEM
marketplace image has restrictions enabled that prevent disk
and SNAP replication to another region. We also know that it is
not possible to define an expiration date when creating a disk
SNAP. Therefore, we must manage expiring SNAP objects when creating
them outside of the tools in the console, or via API, when using
backup schedules and assigning those schedules to storage.

Simply put, run the tool and it:

1) Builds a list of all backup SNAPs in the compartment/region
2) Looks for the last backup SNAP with the same name as the
   new backup SNAP, and if it exists, removes it.
3) Creates the new SNAP.

This utility can be run with the --silent option to suppress
all program output except when an exception is raised.

Fetch all compartment backup data. The underlying function uses the page method in the OCI REST APIs since
the amount of data is copious. Your docker image instance must reserve 1GB RAM for this to work. Begin
by checking this. The function get_compartment_backup_data is complex and required many methods and
functions to run. We ensure this requirement is met by requiring you to pass them to the function.

Explanation of required methods and where you can find them are:

    compute_client                 You should instiate in accordance with KENT codification standards
    get_block_vol_attachments      import from lib.storage
    get_boot_vol_attachments       import from lib.storage
    storage_client                 You should instiate in accordance with KENT codification standards
    child_compartment              You should instiate in accordance with KENT codification standards
    vm_instances                   You should instiate in accordance with KENT codification standards
    
Be sure to read the function backups.get_compartment_backup_data() and get familiar with it before
calling this function. There are comments in the code that explains what it does.
