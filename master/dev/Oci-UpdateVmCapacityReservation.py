The system env var PATHONPATH must be exported in the shell's profile. It must point to the location of the OCI
libraries. This is typically in the same directory structure that the OCI CLI installs to, such as
~./lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages 

Below find a literal example:

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrywojteczko/lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages

'''
There is a defect as of 14-feb-2023 in the rest API service. If an instance is assigned/removed to/from a
capacity reservation resource, used_instance_count is not incremented/decremented. We work around this
defect by requiring the instance to be in a RUNNING state prior to either adding or removiing it
from the resource.

We add a sleep(120) to allow the resource manager sufficient time to apply the update prior to returning
a result. Undefined program behavior could result in the absence of this delay if the command is
repeated in less time than 120 seconds.
