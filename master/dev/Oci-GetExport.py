The system env var PATHONPATH must be exported in the shell's profile. It must point to the location of the OCI
libraries. This is typically in the same directory structure that the OCI CLI installs to, such as
~./lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages 

Below find a literal example:

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrywojteczko/lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages

See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54598292/python-modulenotfounderror-when-trying-to-import-module-from-imported-package

'''

# required built-in modules
import os.path
import sys
from time import sleep
# the following must be added to the python library with PIP and the path to anaconda must be appended to PYTHONPATH
# use caution when modifying the PYTHONPATH env var, test everything
