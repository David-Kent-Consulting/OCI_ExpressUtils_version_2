The system env var PATHONPATH must be exported in the shell's profile. It must point to the location of the OCI
libraries. This is typically in the same directory structure that the OCI CLI installs to, such as
~./lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages 

Below find a literal example:

export PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrywojteczko/lib/oracle-cli/lib/python3.8/site-packages

4. Get parent DB system data

We consider the parent DB system to be the first system that had been created in the DataGuard pair, although
that might not always be the case. We recommend a practice that the parent DB system run at the primary region
within the primary availability domain (AD), and that the secondary or teterary DB system run in a) DR region,
b) within the same region but a different AD.

5. Get the DB homes

We need to get the database objects, to do that we need to get the database home OCIDs

databases within each db_home.

6. Get the databases

There may be one or more CDB databases within a virtual machine, Exedata, or bare metal DB system (bare metal deprecated).
The logic must account for this scenario. Our practice is 1 CDB database per virtual machine database. This must be
checked against each DB home. Our practice is to have 1 DB home per CDB on virtual machine database. The list
databases is populated.
