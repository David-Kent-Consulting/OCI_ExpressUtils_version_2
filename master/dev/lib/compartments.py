class GetParentCompartments:
    '''
    method GetParentCompartments:
    
    This method pulls all parent compartment data using the OCI API and stores to as a dict object
    all compartments that are active. Call like:
         "my_compartments = GetParentCompartment("compartment_name", config, identity_client)

    arguments:

        compartment_name:
            The name of the compartment that is the parent that is the child of the root
            compartment
        config:
            dict object created on the calling program as in "config = oci.config.from_file()"
        identity_client:
            a class object created in the calling program as in
            "identity_client = oci.identity.IdentityClient(config)"

    The config object is created using oci.config.from_file. Your class object must be populated
    only one time to be of use. You may not run a populate a second time. It is notable that the
    entire codebase is dependent on having the parent compartment object from the root
    compartment (tenancy). If a different parent is required, create a new object from this class
    and populate.

    To return the parent compartment name and tenancy, simply print the object. To return the
    parent object, simply call the method after populated as in:
        my_compartments.return_parent_compartment()


    method GetChildCompartments:
    Similar to GetParentCompartments, gets the children from the supplied parent compartment object

    Arguments:

        parent_compartment_id:
            The parent compartment OCID
        config:
           dict object created on the calling program as in "config = oci.config.from_file()"
        identity_client:
            a class object created in the calling program as in
            "identity_client = oci.identity.IdentityClient(config)"

    Method populate_compartments(self)
        This method will read all parent compartments from the root compartment and will append
        self.parent_compartments with all compartments that have an 'ACTIVE' lifecycle state

    Method return_parent_compartment(self)
        This method parses through parent_compartments and returns the parent compartment object
        with the name that matches self.parent_compartment_name if found.
