        '''
        
        This class launches a VM using version 2.24.0 or later of the OCI API.
        It has been tested with Python version 3.8.5. Earlier versions of
        Python 3.x may result in undefined program behavior. It is not compatible
        with Python versions 2.x or earlier.
        
        Yhe methods only support launching an IaaS instance shape type of Flex, 
        and it does not use any depreciated API hooks. It uses the composite API
        so as to wait for either a successful or failed state upon completion of 
        the operation.
        
        Your code must check for duplicates since neither the class or API
        will do this. Your code must handle all exceptions.
        
        Besides loading the OCI APIs, the compartment ID, subnet ID, and host details
        must be provided. The format of the host_details dictionary object must be
        correct.
        
        Usage is straight forward. Begin by instiating the class as in the example below:
        
            launch_vm_instance = LaunchVmInstance(
                compute_composite_client,
                CreateVnicDetails,
                InstanceSourceDetails,
                InstanceSourceViaImageDetails,
                LaunchInstanceDetails,
                LaunchInstanceShapeConfigDetails,
                child_compartment.id,
                subnet.id,
                host_details)
                
        Next, run through each action as explained below for each method. Again, your code
        must handle any exceptions. Please check the values the methods store in the class
        prior to moving onto the next step.
        
        After instiating the class, build the VNIC method.
            launch_vm_instance.build_vnic_details()
            
        Next, build the shape method.
            launch_vm_instance.build_shape()
            
        Now, build the image details method.
            launch_vm_instance.build_instance_image_details()
        
        Now, put it all together and build the method for launching the IaaS instance.
            launch_vm_instance.build_launch_instance_details()
            
        It is important to ensure no errors in any of the preceeding steps prior to
        launching the instance, shown below.
            launch_vm_instance.launch_instance_and_wait_for_state()
            
        The latter method returns a REST API object that represents the state of the
        IaaS instance. Your code has to manage what happens after the instance has
        successfully entered a provisioning state or has entered a failed state.
