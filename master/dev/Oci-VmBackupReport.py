Current metrics suggest around 200MB free RAM are required for the program based on a typical compartment
with around 143MB for the program load and around 545KB per complete record of each VM's metadata and
backup data, presuming 31 days of backups are retained. The utility should be able to collect records
from up to 1600 VMs and live within a heap space of 1GB. In practical terms, we would not consider this
to be a best practice, aka to have thousands of VMs within a single compartment. Regardless, we point
this out since use cases are difficult to predict.
